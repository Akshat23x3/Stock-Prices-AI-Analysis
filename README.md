# Stock-Prices-AI-Analysis

Here is my AI model developed in ide (SPYDER v4.0) based on python where I tried to develop an AI agent that would predict stock prices on predetermined data. I know that it is near impossible to predict stock prices of the coming future but I tried to make my model predict a very near price using deep learning concepts. Using highly sophisticated concepts like ML, Deep learning, and neural networks you can predict almost every statistical data by training the agent on previous data.
